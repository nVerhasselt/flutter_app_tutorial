I am waiting for my exam result and looking for a block release training "Concepteur DÃ©veloppeur d'Application".

I want to make a mobile application and I think I should make it with flutter (the back-end will me made by my collaborator). 

I follow the tutorial of the official documentation to practice before starting my project. 

I am working on the skeleton and the application model with Adobe XD in the same time.
